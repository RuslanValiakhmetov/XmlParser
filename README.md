# XmlParser
This small programm parses XML file content and allows to get info about each XML node in the file.

This project was implemented by using of design patterns such as composite and iterator:
- composite pattern is used to parse XML file content into tree and allows to work with leaf and composite nodes as with nodes of the same type.
- iterator pattern is used to provide access to each node in the Xml tree and to simplify the work with the tree.
